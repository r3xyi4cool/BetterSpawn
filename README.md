BetterCommandSpawn Pro is a fully customizable spawn plugin designed to give server admins full control over player spawn behavior. With its extensive set of features, it goes beyond simple teleportation, allowing you to tailor the spawn experience to fit your server’s needs.

Key features include:

> Custom Command Execution: Execute custom commands whenever a player uses /spawn, making it easy to integrate teleportation,
                          messaging, or other server functions.

> Configurable Permissions: Fine-tune who can access the spawn command and different levels of functionality using a 
                          flexible permission system.

> Teleportation Delay: Set a custom delay before teleportation occurs, adding an element of suspense or preventing 
                       instant spawns.

> Movement Check: Toggle whether teleportation should be canceled if the player moves during the countdown,
                  adding realism and preventing quick escapes.

>Customizable Messages: Easily modify the color and style of messages sent to players when using /spawn,
                        ensuring consistent branding and clear communication.

>Admin Controls: Administrators have full control over the plugin's configuration, from permission settings to teleportation features,
                 allowing a seamless and efficient experience for both players and admins.

CommandSpawn Pro offers a powerful and flexible solution to elevate your server's spawn functionality with advanced customization     and a player-friendly interface.
